							The cards can be categorized into two kinds: normal cards and effect cards.
							<br>
							Normal cards include Rak, Peyper and Sisor. These cards needs a condition so that it can be placed into the playfield, that is to beat the card the card description corresponds to.
							<br>
							e.g. Sisor can only be placed if the current card on the playfield is a Peyper card. It cannot be placed if the current card is a Rak card.
							With the usual Rock-Paper-Scissor rules, the rules also apply to the three cards.
							<br>
							The effect cards on the other hand does not follow any condition. They can be placed on the playfield without following the Rock-Paper-Scissor Rules.
							Once placed, the effect cards will apply their effect towards a player that could be chosen (see Shek and Selep cards) or the player of the current turn.
							If the player who receives an effect has a Sophrem card, he/she can place it on the playfield to deactivate the effect he/she will be receiving.
							<br>
							Normal cards can be placed after the effect card. Any kind of Normal card will do.

						<span class="ga-title">Game Analysis: PUBG (Player Unknown’s Battle Ground)</span>
						<p>Gamers are very-hyped on this game nowadays because of the game concept, strategic gameplay and the competitiveness of the game. From the graphics down to FPS (first-person-shooting), all of it gave birth to a beautiful game.</p>
						
						<span class="ga-head">Game Summary</span>
						<p>
						The game focuses on being the last-man standing on the battlefield by using resources found on the map such as: guns, knives, backpacks, med-kits and even a frying pan to protect yourself.

						There’s no other walkthrough in this game because it relies on your own abilities and how are you going to deal with other 98 people on the field, add in a shrinking battle map and other players also aiming to get the primary object, which is being the top 1 and taking home the Chicken-Dinner.
						</p>
						
						<span class="ga-head">Game Review</span>
						<p>In my experience, the game is completely exciting and fun to play but there are some reasons why gamers aren’t satisfied playing the game.<br>
							Let’s divide our review in two parts, PRO’s and Con’s.</p>
						<span class="ga-head">Pros</span>
						<ul class="steps">
							<li>Fun to play</li>
							<li>Great Graphics</li>
							<li>Wide Playground/Map</li>
							<li>Variety of Weapons according to your play-style</li>
							<li>Party support and great server experience</li>
							<li>Easy Controls</li>
							<li>In-game conversations</li>
						</ul>
						<p>But despite all the glitz and glamour of the game, still these are there are cons to the game.</p>
						<span class="ga-head">Cons</span>
						<ul class="steps">
							<li>Big System Requirement (and when I say big, that’s around 30-50k PHP investment just to play the game)</li>
							<li>Un-optimized assets, the game is still in beta so probably it’ll be fixed soon.</li>
							<li>In-app-purchases that makes the game pay-to-win (Ghillie suit etc.,)</li>
							<li>Bugs and glitches that may soon be fixed.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>All in all, it’s a great game to play and definitely a must for a gamer to try especially those who are fan of FPS games.</p>
